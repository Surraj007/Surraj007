- 👋 Hi, I’m Suraj Kumar
Innovative and driven web developer with a strong foundation in C programming, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Php and MySQL.
I kickstarted my journey with a "State-level hackathon", where I crafted the 'Get Interact' app with my team. Building on that success, I teamed up for a "National-level event", creating the 'Student Helper' app, designed to make campus life easier for students."
I have completed internships with Codsoft, Cognifyz, and IBM, where I gained hands-on experience in software and web development.
My projects include creating a sustainable development website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as developing an educational communication platform.
I have demonstrated strong leadership and project management skills by leading teams in hackathon settings and achieving top ranks in competitions.
I am passionate about developing solutions that make a positive impact and continually seek opportunities to learn and grow in the field of web development.
